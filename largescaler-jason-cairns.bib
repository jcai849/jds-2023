  abstract  = {From the Publisher: The only guide to UNIX network programming APIs you'll ever need! Whether you write Web servers, client/server applications, or any other network software, you need to understand networking APIS--especially sockets in greater detail than ever before. You need UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1, Second Edition. In this book, leading UNIX networking expert W. Richard Stevens offers unprecedented, start-to-finish guidance on making the most of sockets, the de facto standard for UNIX network programming--as well as extensive coverage of the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI). Stevens begins by introducing virtually every basic capability of TCP and UDP sockets, including socket functions and options, I/O multiplexing, and name and address conversions. He presents detailed coverage of the Posix.1g standard for sockets and the Posix threads. He also introduces advanced techniques for: Establishing IPv4/IPv6 interoperability. Implementing non-blocking I/O. Routing sockets. Broadcasting and multicasting. IP options. Multithreading. Advanced name and address conversions. UNIX domain protocols. Raw sockets. Learn how to choose among today's leading client/server design approaches, including TCP iterative, concurrent, preforked and prethreaded servers. Master the X/Open Transport Interface, including XTI TCP clients and servers, name and address functions, options, streams and additional functions. The Internet/intranet revolution has dramatically increased the demand for developers with a sophisticated understanding of network programming APIs, especially sockets. One book contains all you need to know: UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1, Second Edition.}
